Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.63,0:00:21.79,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,W-Well, that was some decent force.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.43,0:00:24.03,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,{\i1}Is this guy for real?!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.03,0:00:27.31,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,{\i1}He could give Nanami{**-san} a run for his money in terms of physical blows.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.31,0:00:29.54,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,{\i1}Though I suppose that's why...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.54,0:00:32.26,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,It's a rather sturdy Veil.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.26,0:00:34.53,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,We'll have to search for its weak point
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.53,0:00:37.05,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,and put a hole in it, even if it's only for a second.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.05,0:00:39.85,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,We can't get anywhere without getting inside first.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.67,0:00:42.55,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Huh? Why not?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.55,0:00:44.35,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Why not?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.35,0:00:47.86,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Listen, this is a Veil to keep sorcerers out.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.86,0:00:50.19,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,It's a barrier.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.19,0:00:53.91,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Barriers are all designed to surround you and protect yourself, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.91,0:00:57.36,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Which fundamentally means that whoever lowered this Veil
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.36,0:01:00.08,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,is inside it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.90,0:01:03.99,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,But back in Harajuku...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.79,0:01:09.79,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,I see!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.79,0:01:13.58,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,So staying outside the Veil instead of surrounding themselves with it increases
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.58,0:01:15.79,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,the risk of being discovered and defeated,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.79,0:01:17.79,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,thereby raising the strength of the Veil.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.53,0:01:20.69,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,It's a real egg of Columbus idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.69,0:01:22.02,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Egg?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.02,0:01:26.02,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Though, man, they're completely ignoring the fundamentals of barriers!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.02,0:01:27.82,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,What a crazy idea!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.16,0:01:32.88,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Now I can see why the barrier didn't break from Yuji's earlier blow.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.88,0:01:34.37,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,If that's the logic,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.37,0:01:38.09,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,the Veil's source should be somewhere that really stands out, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.39,0:01:40.95,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,By increasing the risk of discovery,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.95,0:01:43.43,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,they're further increasing its strength, then?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.99,0:01:47.83,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Somewhere that stands out?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.30,0:01:56.80,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,Think the sorcerers will realize it?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.58,0:02:07.55,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,This is the place that stands out the most within the Veil, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.55,0:02:09.29,Default,Ogami,0,0,0,,Probably.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.29,0:02:12.14,Default,Grandson,0,0,0,,But even if they do realize it...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.62,0:02:13.89,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.61,0:02:18.69,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,The lower floors are swarming with those transfigured humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.52,0:02:22.88,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,They won't be able to climb up here that fast.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.61,0:02:28.95,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,{\i1}Wires?!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.22,0:02:30.60,Default,Maki,0,0,0,,These are great.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.62,0:02:43.93,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,{\i1}Do these bastards know about the entrusted Veil?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.03,0:02:47.39,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,{\i1}Good! Just as planned!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.01,0:02:50.52,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,So this is the source of the Veil?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.52,0:02:52.61,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Yeah. According to Mei{**-san},
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.61,0:02:55.62,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,it already has the barrier programmed in,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.62,0:02:59.48,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,and it just needs someone to pour cursed energy into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.48,0:03:02.61,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Which means as long as we destroy those,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.61,0:03:05.49,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,we can ignore the curse users until later.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.75,0:03:08.83,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,{\i1}There were three of them?!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.70,0:03:12.08,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,{\i1}The Veil keeping sorcerers out is still active.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.08,0:03:13.82,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,{\i1}Where are the remaining two?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.01,0:03:16.21,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,With him?!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.11,0:03:34.11,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Fushiguro! Dismiss Nue!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.92,0:03:43.19,Default,Ogami,0,0,0,,Grandson.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.67,0:03:47.11,Default,Grandson,0,0,0,,Yes, I know, Granny.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.63,0:03:50.56,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,I have some endearing underclassmen now,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.56,0:03:54.29,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,so it's time to earn some achievements here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.66,0:03:58.28,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,so I can become a first-grade, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.39,0:04:03.39,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Fushiguro!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.63,0:04:05.75,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Where is he?!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.75,0:04:07.13,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Right there.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.11,0:04:11.46,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,I didn't see the moment of impact.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.78,0:04:14.50,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,His body is too clean.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.72,0:04:17.31,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Even if he is a sorcerer,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.31,0:04:20.31,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,he plummeted from the 41st floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.31,0:04:23.31,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Get up, you old trickster!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.56,0:04:30.04,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,Good grief.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.00,0:04:37.51,Default,Awasaka,0,0,0,,Youngsters these days have no pity for the elderly.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.92,0:04:39.91,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,We can't waste time here.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.95,0:06:21.27,Default,Nanami,0,0,0,,Why are you so insistent on my recommendation?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.70,0:06:25.78,Default,Nanami,0,0,0,,You could easily become semi-first-grade with your technique.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.50,0:06:30.05,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Because I believe it's important to do things the right way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.45,0:06:34.03,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Especially with bloody work like being a sorcerer.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.54,0:06:39.54,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,But I'm not that bright, so sometimes I don't know what the right way is.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.01,0:06:43.90,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,So whenever I'm at a loss, I think to myself,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.04,0:06:52.25,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,So it wouldn't be right to become a first-grade without your approval.
