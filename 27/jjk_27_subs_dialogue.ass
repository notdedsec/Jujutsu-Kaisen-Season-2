Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.46,0:01:03.92,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Something like trading Amanai for Kuroi{**-san},
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.92,0:01:06.92,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,or saying they'll kill Kuroi{**-san} if we don't kill Amanai.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.01,0:01:11.51,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,But we have the leverage in any negotiations since we have Amanai.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.04,0:05:18.63,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,And while we were in the air, I had my cursed spirit keep watch outside.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.63,0:05:23.14,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,It was safer than using a land route.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.39,0:05:29.64,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I'm more curious as to why they designated Okinawa for the exchange.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.02,0:05:32.15,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,Probably to buy time, right?
Dialogue: 1,0:05:32.73,0:05:34.61,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,Even if they fail to kill Riko-sama,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:34.61,0:05:37.15,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,they could keep her from making tomorrow's full moon deadline.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.69,0:05:42.11,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,they would choose a rural area with poor transit infrastructure.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.11,0:05:45.66,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,You don't think they're planning to take over the airport, do you?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.66,0:05:46.99,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Maybe so.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.99,0:05:48.12,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,But we'll be fine.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:48.62,0:05:51.58,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,We're not the only ones who came here.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.95,0:06:27.99,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Satoru's the one who suggested it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.70,0:06:31.87,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,He's probably showing consideration for Riko{**-chan}, in his own way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.79,0:06:34.25,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Though it is getting close...

Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.14,0:06:56.02,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Besides...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.56,0:07:00.94,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,there are fewer curse users in Okinawa than there are in Tokyo.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.94,0:07:03.32,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Let's keep it a little more serious, Satoru.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.15,0:07:07.91,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,It's better if the time limit on the bounty runs out while we're mid-flight, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.90,0:07:06.78,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,{\an8}Young lady, a starfish.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.88,0:07:19.71,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Are you sure we don't need to go back to Jujutsu Tech?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.84,0:07:23.84,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,It's not a problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.84,0:07:27.59,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Playing through 99 years of {\i1}MomoTetsu{\i0} was far more draining.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.44,0:07:41.36,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,Nanami, they said they're extending their stay another day!
