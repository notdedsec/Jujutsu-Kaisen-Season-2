Dialogue: 0,0:18:31.75,0:18:36.21,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,Did you know that when adding effects to the barrier of a Veil,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:36.21,0:18:39.71,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,you can basically only apply them to "things with cursed energy"?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:39.71,0:18:43.42,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,That's roughly people, cursed spirits, and cursed objects.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:43.42,0:18:47.93,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,So blocking cell phone signals is just a side effect of a Veil being lowered,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:47.93,0:18:52.89,Default,Ino,0,0,0,,and you can't actually integrate the surrounding signal into a Veil's barrier.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:53.48,0:18:56.10,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Oh, yes, I knew that.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:12.87,0:19:15.58,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,It would seem something has happened there.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:15.58,0:19:20.38,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,Everyone who came running up to the edge of the Veil to escape cried the same thing:

Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.51,0:19:25.43,Default,Naobito,0,0,0,,{\an8}Hmph.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:25.43,0:19:28.80,Default,Naobito,0,0,0,,{\an8}There's no way any non-sorcerers know his name.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:28.80,0:19:30.51,Default,Naobito,0,0,0,,{\an8}They're being forced to say that.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.89,0:19:32.68,Default,Naobito,0,0,0,,We can't break the Veil?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:33.43,0:19:35.14,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,We're having a hard time with that.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.14,0:19:39.19,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,The Veil isn't preventing sorcerers from entering or leaving.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:39.56,0:19:42.60,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,we can't just break it by force.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:42.60,0:19:46.92,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,It'll be much faster to find the curse user who lowered it and beat them up.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.28,0:19:49.91,Default,Maki,0,0,0,,Then our job is to help with that, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.28,0:19:51.16,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,No!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:51.16,0:19:53.79,Default,Nitta,0,0,0,,You all are to wait here on standby!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:56.04,0:19:59.82,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,They lowered an advanced barrier and called out Satoru Gojo by name.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:00.21,0:20:03.88,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,{\an8}This is likely the same culprits behind the attack on the exchange event.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:03.88,0:20:06.80,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,{\an8}The upper brass want to minimize casualties,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:06.80,0:20:11.55,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,{\an8}so they've decided to send Satoru Gojo in alone to restore order to Shibuya.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:12.68,0:20:17.85,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,Us, Nanami, Zenin's old man, and Mei Mei, too.

Dialogue: 0,0:20:31.20,0:20:34.44,Default,Panda,0,0,0,,They don't care about any casualties among regular people, do they?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:34.44,0:20:36.45,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,Don't get bristly with me.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:36.45,0:20:39.67,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,Unlike last year's Night Parade of a Hundred Demons on Christmas,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:39.67,0:20:41.17,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,events are already in motion.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:41.17,0:20:43.42,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,I think this was the best call, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:43.42,0:20:46.63,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,Besides, I had a peek inside the Veil earlier,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:46.63,0:20:48.48,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,and it was pretty peaceful.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:48.48,0:20:50.51,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,Regular people were panicking, sure,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:50.51,0:20:53.93,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,but there weren't any cursed spirits or curse users going around killing them.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:53.93,0:20:57.30,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,At present, those regular people are just trapped inside.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:57.85,0:21:01.27,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,Though, honestly, I don't want to go back inside there again.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:01.27,0:21:02.44,Default,Panda,0,0,0,,Why's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:02.90,0:21:05.82,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,It was in Hikarie, I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:06.69,0:21:10.74,Default,Kusakabe,0,0,0,,{\an8}Most likely, there's lots of special-grade cursed spirits underground.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.74,0:21:13.07,Default,RegularPeople,0,0,0,,What's going on?!
Dialogue: 0,0:21:13.07,0:21:14.49,Default,RegularPeople,0,0,0,,Why can't we pass through here?!

Dialogue: 0,0:21:20.79,0:21:23.50,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,But we were told we can't get out unless he comes here!
Dialogue: 0,0:21:23.50,0:21:24.30,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,Who said that?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:24.30,0:21:26.09,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,I don't know! Everyone!
Dialogue: 0,0:21:26.09,0:21:29.42,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,What do you think of guys who can't keep a cool head at times like these?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:29.42,0:21:32.47,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,Well, being trapped is something out of a horror film,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:32.47,0:21:34.51,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,but we're not really in that much trouble, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:34.51,0:21:36.26,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,I'm sure help will come soon.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:36.26,0:21:38.39,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,Oh, but we have no signal!

Dialogue: 0,0:21:55.78,0:21:56.33,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,Huh?!
Dialogue: 0,0:21:56.66,0:21:59.34,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,Then why don't you go ahead and make it so smart people can pass through?!
Dialogue: 0,0:22:00.71,0:22:02.21,Default,Youth,0,0,0,,Ow.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:05.50,0:22:06.92,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Oh, sorry.
