Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.20,0:02:00.12,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,it means advancing humanity to the next stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.42,0:02:05.76,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,{\i1}Now, I need to buy time for Larue to act.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.59,0:02:09.93,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Humanity's next stage is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.93,0:02:13.15,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,freeing itself from cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.09,0:02:18.12,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,No. It's optimizing cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.50,0:02:26.41,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Uh, I don't get it, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.80,0:02:32.92,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I thought you already gave on your plan twelve years ago, when Zenin Toji died.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.92,0:02:35.92,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I was talking to Geto{**-kun}, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.97,0:02:38.67,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Well, whatever.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.51,0:02:41.66,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I went back to my original idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.66,0:02:45.29,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Besides, there's a big hole in your optimization plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.68,0:02:51.31,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Extremely few sorcerers and cursed spirits emerge in other countries compared to Japan.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.19,0:02:57.43,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,So Tengen's barriers should be indispensable to your optimization plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.50,0:03:02.47,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Using Tengen to optimize cursed energy would mean

Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.84,0:03:11.33,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Japan would practically have a monopoly on cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.10,0:03:16.00,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Other nations, especially that superpower, wouldn't stand by and allow that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.11,0:03:19.76,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Flesh-and-blood humans would become an energy source.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.76,0:03:24.01,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,It's easy enough to imagine what misfortune that would bring.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.35,0:03:30.52,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That's a world far removed from the ideals I pursue.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.59,0:03:34.14,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,So what?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.83,0:03:37.40,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,For one thing, our objectives are different.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.28,0:03:58.39,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Though that shouldn't be anywhere near the full extent.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.94,0:04:01.17,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I tried to give rise
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.17,0:04:03.94,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,to other possibilities for mankind on my own.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.93,0:04:10.54,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,But that didn't work out.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.54,0:04:12.42,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Everything that I created myself
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.66,0:04:15.34,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,was limited by the bounds of my own potential.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.78,0:04:21.11,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,The answer was always glimmering darkly within chaos.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.80,0:04:23.20,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Do you understand?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.20,0:04:25.30,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,What I should have created
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.30,0:04:28.41,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,was chaos that went beyond my own control.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.84,0:04:32.41,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I've already finished extracting the technique.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.55,0:04:36.68,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,There was a cursed spirit called Mahito, right?!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.68,0:04:39.26,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,The one with the technique that let it interfere with souls!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.26,0:04:41.05,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,That guy absorbed it earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.05,0:04:42.34,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Seriously?!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.93,0:04:46.85,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Idle Transfiguration.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.61,0:05:12.71,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Tengen's barrier? No, this is...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.92,0:05:15.33,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Remote activation of a cursed technique?!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.33,0:05:18.92,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,You have my thanks, Itadori Yuji.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.92,0:05:23.42,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,A cursed spirit's mastery of their technique ceases to progress
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.42,0:05:26.80,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,from the moment they're absorbed by Cursed Spirit Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.10,0:05:30.30,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Mahito truly matured through his fight with you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.86,0:05:35.76,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,To be honest, I wanted to have Jogo, as well, but no matter.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.42,0:05:38.14,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,What did you do?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.42,0:05:41.33,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I remotely activated Idle Transfiguration on
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.33,0:05:44.25,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,two types of non-sorcerers that I marked ahead of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.06,0:06:14.06,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,One type was people whom I had absorb cursed objects like Itadori Yuji did,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.65,0:06:18.54,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,and the other was people like Junpei Yoshino who have cursed techniques,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.54,0:06:21.56,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,but whose brains were structured like non-sorcerers.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.56,0:06:25.32,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Now I've adjusted their brains to match those of sorcerers.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.83,0:06:28.45,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,For the former, I gave them the strength to be vessels,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.45,0:06:32.58,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,and the latter have obtained the ability to activate their techniques.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.88,0:06:35.22,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,And now...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.44,0:06:42.33,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I've released the seal on those cursed objects.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.05,0:06:45.54,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Some of them have been in a deep sleep
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.54,0:06:48.36,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,after being exposed to my cursed energy when I marked them,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.36,0:06:50.36,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,but they'll soon awaken.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.70,0:06:53.66,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,So, starting now,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.66,0:06:57.80,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I'll have them kill each other in order to deepen their understanding of cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.44,0:07:01.63,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I've carefully hand-picked these people and cursed objects.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.63,0:07:06.66,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Think of it as unleashing a thousand malevolent Itadori Yujis.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.36,0:07:08.95,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,A thousand?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.95,0:07:10.22,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That's conservative.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.58,0:07:13.21,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,You're also underestimating human rationality.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.71,0:07:15.35,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Do you think people will start
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.35,0:07:17.96,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,killing each other just because they were granted power?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.34,0:07:20.84,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,There's an order to everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.16,0:07:25.02,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I certainly didn't cut corners like that when making my preparations.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.46,0:07:27.88,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Your questions are starting to become shallow.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.88,0:07:33.44,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,He's pissing me off, so let's all beat him up together!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.44,0:07:35.95,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,I can't move right now, though...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.24,0:07:54.12,Default,Choso,0,0,0,,My blood got mixed with yours through Piercing Blood.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.12,0:07:55.24,Default,Choso,0,0,0,,Of course it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.80,0:07:58.60,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,Wait, we're not getting cover from Mai{**-chan}.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.60,0:08:01.18,Default,Momo,0,0,0,,They might still have more allies over there.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.50,0:08:08.00,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,My ally is protecting Aoi, the girl with the gun, and that suit.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.46,0:08:34.96,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Of course, I forged my pacts with more than just sorcerers,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.17,0:08:41.79,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,though my pacts with those were annulled when I obtained this body.
