Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.65,0:17:31.92,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,The people in Q wore even weirder outfits.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:33.65,0:17:35.78,Default,Bag,0,0,0,,If you're killing someone, do it without talking.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:39.95,0:17:41.12,Default,Bag,0,0,0,,Too slow.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:09.07,0:18:10.23,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Where's Riko{**-chan}?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.02,0:18:13.61,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,She left the school with Gojo-sama.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:13.61,0:18:16.28,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Then we should head that way, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:16.28,0:18:18.69,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,This has gotten a bit troublesome.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:19.95,0:18:22.74,Default,Bag,0,0,0,,So that really was the thirty million earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:25.75,0:18:27.16,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,A shikigami?!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:27.16,0:18:29.62,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,No, it's not quite the same as a shikigami.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:30.00,0:18:31.04,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Satoru.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:31.42,0:18:34.25,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,There's a bounty of thirty million on Amanai's head?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:34.25,0:18:38.22,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Yeah. It was posted on an underground site for curse users.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:38.22,0:18:40.93,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Apparently, the time limit is 11 AM the day after tomorrow.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:41.43,0:18:42.93,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Now things make sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:43.90,0:18:47.68,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,Two, three, four... They all look the same.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:47.68,0:18:48.98,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,Are they shikigami?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:49.33,0:18:53.65,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Jeez... And jujutsu sorcerers are short-handed all year round.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:53.65,0:18:56.67,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,If you want to change jobs, we'll welcome you, old man.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:16.46,0:19:18.19,Default,Bag,0,0,0,,What did you just do?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:18.45,0:19:20.01,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,The shikigami isn't disappearing!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:20.01,0:19:21.72,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,Which is the real one?!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:21.72,0:19:22.99,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,They're not shikigami.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:22.99,0:19:24.30,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,They're clones.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.30,0:19:26.56,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,And each one is the real one.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:31.23,0:19:32.77,Default,Bag,0,0,0,,The hell is this?!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.77,0:19:33.69,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Infinity.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:33.69,0:19:35.40,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,It's Achilles and the Tortoise.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.40,0:19:36.23,Default,Bag,0,0,0,,Huh?!
Dialogue: 0,0:19:36.23,0:19:38.74,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,It's important to study, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:40.82,0:19:44.24,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Yours is a cloning technique that allows a maximum of five, including the original.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.24,0:19:48.12,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,And you're always free to decide which of the clones is the main body, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:48.12,0:19:50.33,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,So if your main body is in danger,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.33,0:19:52.79,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,you make a safe clone the main body.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:52.79,0:19:54.75,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,That's a nice technique you have there.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:54.75,0:19:57.67,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I don't understand why you're so weak.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:58.63,0:20:02.15,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Are you unable to produce a clone for a while after it's destroyed?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.15,0:20:04.64,Default,Bag,0,0,0,,How do you know what my technique is?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:04.64,0:20:06.22,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Unfortunately for you,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:06.22,0:20:07.97,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I have good eyes.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:08.62,0:20:10.64,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,You see, my technique
Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.64,0:20:13.73,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,is like a convergent series of infinite numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:13.73,0:20:16.59,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Anything that approaches me grows slower and slower,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:16.59,0:20:19.57,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,and ultimately, it fails to ever reach me.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:20.10,0:20:22.61,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,When I amplify my Limitless technique,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.61,0:20:25.37,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I get what you might call a negative natural number.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:25.37,0:20:28.95,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,It basically creates a single imaginary apple.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:29.58,0:20:32.58,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Doing so causes everything around to get sucked into that space, like you saw.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:32.87,0:20:34.58,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Though it's surprisingly inconvenient.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:34.83,0:20:38.75,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I can't create too large a reaction near myself,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:38.75,0:20:41.05,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,and if I start worrying about the vectors, too,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:41.05,0:20:44.01,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,controlling the cursed energy becomes a real pain.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:44.47,0:20:46.98,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Basically, it's super exhausting.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:50.22,0:20:54.23,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,But that's all just the proper operation of the technique.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:56.02,0:20:57.90,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Protect your head.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.66,0:21:16.96,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,This next one is the divergence of infinity.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:19.25,0:21:21.06,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,My reverse cursed technique,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:22.67,0:21:23.55,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Red!
Dialogue: 0,0:21:38.86,0:21:40.36,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I failed!
Dialogue: 0,0:21:50.28,0:21:53.24,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I really thought I could do it that time.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:54.08,0:21:56.25,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,{\i1}Is this guy for real?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:59.17,0:22:00.59,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,It's from Kuroi.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:02.92,0:22:04.42,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,Wh-What do we do?!
Dialogue: 0,0:22:04.42,0:22:05.51,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,Kuroi has...
Dialogue: 0,0:22:06.18,0:22:07.43,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,Kuroi has been...

Dialogue: 0,0:23:40.48,0:23:42.65,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,I've always thought the voices of young people should be heard,
Dialogue: 0,0:23:42.65,0:23:44.74,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,so I've voted in every election,
Dialogue: 0,0:23:44.74,0:23:48.15,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,but now I'm debating how long it's actually okay to consider myself a young person.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:48.15,0:23:49.53,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,{\an8}Next time, "Hidden Inventory 3"!
Dialogue: 0,0:23:49.53,0:23:50.79,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,{\an8}Be sure to watch!
Dialogue: 0,0:23:50.79,0:23:52.37,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,{\an8}Exactly how old are you, Kuroi?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:52.37,0:23:53.12,Default,Kuroi,0,0,0,,{\an8}It's a sekwet!
Dialogue: 0,0:23:53.12,0:23:54.29,Default,Riko,0,0,0,,{\an8}Oh, how cute!
