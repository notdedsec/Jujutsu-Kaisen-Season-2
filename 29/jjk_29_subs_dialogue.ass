Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.97,0:01:34.82,Default,Shoko,0,0,0,,Here we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.68,0:01:41.45,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Yeah, it's working.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.45,0:01:44.28,Default,Shoko,0,0,0,,Ugh, what the heck was that?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.28,0:01:46.91,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Automatic selection of targets for your jujutsu technique?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.91,0:01:47.91,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Yup.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.91,0:01:51.05,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Though, to be precise, I'm the target for the technique.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.40,0:01:54.63,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I've automated what I used to do manually.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.63,0:01:56.42,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Now it can discern an object's danger level
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.71,0:02:01.30,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,based on the strength of its cursed energy, its mass, its velocity, and its shape.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.30,0:02:04.49,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I'd like to get it to discern poisons, too,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.49,0:02:06.47,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,but that's still proving difficult.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.47,0:02:09.11,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,This will allow me to keep my Limitless technique active
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.11,0:02:11.61,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,almost perpetually with minimal resources.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.61,0:02:14.57,Default,Shoko,0,0,0,,Having it perpetually active will fry your brain.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.57,0:02:17.01,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,But I can also keep running the reverse cursed technique
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.01,0:02:18.66,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,with the energy I generate on my own.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.66,0:02:21.20,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,So I'm constantly giving it a fresh brain to work with.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.97,0:02:24.75,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I'd already been working on shortening my hand seals. That's nailed now, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.75,0:02:30.00,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,So I can also activate multiple instances of Blue and Red simultaneously.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.00,0:02:31.42,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,The only remaining hurdles are
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.42,0:02:34.17,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Domain Expansion and teleportation over long distances.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.67,0:02:36.83,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I should be able to get that down if we set up
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.83,0:02:39.67,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,some courses without any obstacles in Jujutsu Tech.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.64,0:02:53.64,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}He handled all of his missions alone,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.64,0:02:57.27,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}and Shoko was never sent out on dangerous missions in the first place,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.71,0:03:01.13,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}which naturally meant I was sent on missions alone more often, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.53,0:03:03.33,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,It's just heat fatigue.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.33,0:03:04.80,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I'll be fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.55,0:03:07.29,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Did you eat too much somen?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.78,0:03:11.23,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Things were busy that summer.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.29,0:03:19.84,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Likely spurred by the frequent disasters of the past year,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.55,0:03:22.93,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}cursed spirits were springing up like maggots.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.43,0:03:26.67,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Exorcise, absorb.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.67,0:03:28.05,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Over and over.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.64,0:03:29.54,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Exorcise.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.54,0:03:30.51,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Absorb.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.52,0:03:34.43,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}No one else understands what cursed spirits taste like.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.87,0:03:38.27,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}It's like swallowing a dirty rag that's been used to clean up shit and vomit.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.98,0:03:42.41,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Who am I doing this for?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.44,0:03:47.59,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Exorcise.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.59,0:03:48.41,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Absorb.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.39,0:03:52.76,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}Ever since that day, I've been telling myself,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.76,0:03:55.51,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}"What I witnessed isn't uncommon."
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.51,0:03:59.44,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}"I understood the ugliness of the masses,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.44,0:04:03.84,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}"and still chose to be a jujutsu sorcerer to save others."

Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.63,0:04:50.01,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Want something to drink?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.21,0:04:52.57,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,Huh? No, I'd feel bad!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.57,0:04:53.55,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,But I'll take a cola!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.51,0:04:59.65,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,I'm going pretty far away for my mission tomorrow.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.65,0:05:00.83,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,That so?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.83,0:05:02.27,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Bring back souvenirs.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.27,0:05:03.48,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,Of course!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.48,0:05:06.52,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,Do you prefer sweet stuff or salty stuff?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.30,0:05:11.16,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Satoru might eat some, too, so... sweet, I guess?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.38,0:05:12.75,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Got it!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.65,0:05:17.73,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Haibara...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.20,0:05:21.79,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Do you think you can keep going as a jujutsu sorcerer? It's not too hard for you?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.28,0:05:24.63,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,Well...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.73,0:05:29.51,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,I'm not really one to think about things too deeply,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.83,0:05:34.14,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,so it feels really good to be able to give my all to something I can actually do.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.07,0:05:37.20,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.09,0:05:39.20,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Yeah, it does.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.35,0:06:03.67,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,I'm a great judge of character!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.88,0:06:06.51,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,You say that while sitting next to me?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.97,0:06:09.07,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,Yes!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.88,0:06:13.49,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,He was being sarcastic, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.87,0:06:16.05,Default,Haibara,0,0,0,,Excuse me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.19,0:06:18.65,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Your underclassman?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.65,0:06:20.78,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,He's cute. I like how frank he is.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.78,0:06:24.09,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I think he should be more suspicious of people as a sorcerer.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.09,0:06:27.82,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,So, are you not going to answer?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.30,0:06:31.06,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Please answer my question first.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.06,0:06:32.33,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Who are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.67,0:06:35.44,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.44,0:06:37.24,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That ring any bells?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.03,0:06:39.51,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,You're {\i1}her{\i0}?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.51,0:06:42.08,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Oh, I like the sound of that! What do they say?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.20,0:06:46.19,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,That you're a special-grade who never accepts any missions,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.19,0:06:49.47,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,and you're a good-for-nothing who's been wandering around abroad.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.47,0:06:52.57,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I hate Jujutsu Tech.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.57,0:06:53.47,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,{\i1}She's pouting.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.91,0:06:55.12,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I'm joking.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.12,0:06:59.25,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Though it's true that I don't get along with Jujutsu Tech's policies.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.25,0:07:02.84,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,What they're doing is just treating symptoms,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.84,0:07:05.36,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,and I want to do something to treat the cause.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.75,0:07:07.57,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Treat the cause?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.57,0:07:09.87,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Rather than hunt down cursed spirits,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.87,0:07:13.03,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I want to create a world where cursed spirits aren't born.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.79,0:07:17.66,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Care for a little lesson?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.13,0:07:20.65,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,What are cursed spirits to begin with?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.65,0:07:23.48,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,They're creatures that take shape when cursed energy
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.48,0:07:26.79,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,leaking from humans builds up like sediment.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.79,0:07:28.65,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Excellent.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.65,0:07:33.05,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Now this means there are two ways to create a world where cursed spirits aren't born.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.05,0:07:36.99,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,One: Eliminate cursed energy from mankind.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.99,0:07:41.06,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Two: Make it possible for all of humanity to control their cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.29,0:07:44.82,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I thought number one had a pretty good chance of working.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.21,0:07:47.05,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,There was a model case for it, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.05,0:07:48.51,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,A model case?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.51,0:07:50.78,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Someone you know well.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.78,0:07:52.40,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Toji Zenin.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.30,0:07:55.84,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I've seen plenty of cases where a Heavenly Pact reduced
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.84,0:07:58.76,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,a person's cursed energy to the level of your average person,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.76,0:08:00.90,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,but you could search the whole world only to find
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.90,0:08:03.55,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,he was the only case in which that cursed energy dropped to zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.51,0:08:07.98,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That wasn't the only intriguing thing about him, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.41,0:08:11.66,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Even though Zenin Toji had zero cursed energy,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.66,0:08:14.08,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,he was able to perceive cursed spirits with his five senses.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.08,0:08:16.43,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,By completely casting aside cursed energy,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.43,0:08:18.29,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,his body drew a hard line
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.29,0:08:21.18,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,and actually gave him great resistance to curses.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.41,0:08:23.28,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,He truly was superhuman.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.66,0:08:25.81,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,You shouldn't be ashamed of losing to him.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.74,0:08:30.73,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,I wanted to try studying him, but he turned me down.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.73,0:08:32.69,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,It was a real shame to lose him.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.19,0:08:35.66,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,And there aren't many people with Heavenly Pacts,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.66,0:08:38.35,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,so I'm currently favoring route number two,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.35,0:08:42.04,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,making it possible for all of humanity to control their cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.88,0:08:44.04,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Did you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.52,0:08:46.99,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Cursed spirits aren't born from sorcerers.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.94,0:08:50.85,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Of course, that excludes cases where the jujutsu sorcerer
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.85,0:08:52.64,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,turns themselves into a curse after death.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.25,0:08:57.79,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Compared to non-sorcerers, jujutsu sorcerers leak extremely little cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.14,0:09:00.26,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,There's some variance based on the sorcerer's capacity
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.26,0:09:02.56,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,and the amount of cursed energy their technique expends,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.88,0:09:05.16,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,but the main reason is their flow.
