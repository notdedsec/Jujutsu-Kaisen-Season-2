Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.42,0:06:01.21,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,which would you prefer? Killing lots of weak, transfigured humans,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.88,0:06:47.38,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,Also, my crows got hunted down here, between B1 and B2.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.38,0:06:51.43,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,This is likely where the cursed spirit or curse user who lowered the Veil is.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.97,0:06:55.60,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,Maybe they're planning to hunt down any common people that come back up,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.60,0:06:57.98,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,or maybe it has something to do with the Veils' conditions,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.98,0:06:59.85,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,but it's unclear why they've chosen
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.85,0:07:03.71,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,this positioning, and what they hope to achieve by isolating level B5.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.36,0:07:07.65,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,He's here, though, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.58,0:07:09.90,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Right below us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.78,0:07:11.82,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,That curse.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.78,0:07:14.07,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,Maybe?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.07,0:07:19.08,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,My crows all got killed before they could confirm seeing Patchface.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.08,0:07:23.58,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,Though the presence of transfigured humans would suggest that's likely.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.13,0:07:26.92,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,I'm not so sure about dividing up our forces,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.92,0:07:30.88,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,but if we keep wasting time, all the common people on B4 will be wiped out.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.88,0:07:37.76,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,The two of us will take Exit 7 directly to B4 and rescue the civilians.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.31,0:07:42.14,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,If it gets too dangerous, you head down there, as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.14,0:07:46.86,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,Though, if I can be greedy, I hope that by the time we reunite,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.86,0:07:50.24,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,the Veil will be lifted, the civilians will be freed,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.24,0:07:54.87,Default,Mei,0,0,0,,and we'll know what our opponent on B5 is after.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.82,0:07:58.04,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Don't worry, Mei{**-san}.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.70,0:08:01.46,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,I won't lose anymore.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.45,0:08:35.61,Default,Ko-guy,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.61,0:08:37.82,Default,Ko-guy,0,0,0,,I'm clever.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.45,0:08:41.25,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,The patchfaced cursed spirit is here, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.25,0:08:42.37,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Where is he?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.75,0:08:47.58,Default,Ko-guy,0,0,0,,Patch... face? Patchface?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.34,0:08:50.75,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,The one with stitches all over his face.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.38,0:08:54.09,Default,Ko-guy,0,0,0,,Don't insult me! I know that much!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.09,0:08:56.34,Default,Ko-guy,0,0,0,,I'm clever!

Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.84,0:09:09.38,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,{\i1}No, its name doesn't matter right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.74,0:09:12.21,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Barriers are pretty complicated, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.21,0:09:15.49,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,There are plenty of people who are strong and still can't do them.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.49,0:09:17.64,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Though I'm both strong and capable.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.20,0:09:21.33,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,{\i1}This thing is responsible for the Veil? Both of them?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.33,0:09:22.58,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,{\i1}Doesn't seem likely...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.12,0:09:27.83,Default,Ko-guy,0,0,0,,Mahito's sorcery is bad.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.04,0:09:32.63,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,{\i1}He did say he was "protecting the Veil."
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.63,0:09:34.97,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,{\i1}Which makes that object very suspicious.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.97,0:09:36.63,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,{\i1}I'll smash it for starters.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.63,0:09:38.01,Default,Ko-guy,0,0,0,,Did you know?

Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.72,0:11:48.85,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,{\i1}What an incredible jaw and jump.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:34.00,0:18:38.88,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,The minimum output of his cursed technique reversal is double that of his amplification.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:38.88,0:18:42.80,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,It'll be nearly impossible for him to use it without catching non-sorcerers in it, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:42.80,0:18:47.90,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,He probably won't be able to charge his Blue up to an effective output, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:51.23,0:18:54.90,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,It should prove difficult for him to use Blue for high-speed movement, as well.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:45.07,0:19:46.62,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,Makes sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:46.62,0:19:50.29,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I suppose you would think of that after allying with curse users.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:51.37,0:19:53.04,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}Domain Amplification...
Dialogue: 0,0:19:53.04,0:19:55.96,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}It's the same principle as the New Shadow School's simple domain.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:56.39,0:19:58.84,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}They envelop themselves with the domain.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:58.84,0:20:00.72,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}While that reduces its guaranteed-hit effect,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:00.72,0:20:03.64,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}it ensures they neutralize any technique used.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:06.93,0:20:11.16,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,{\i1}That would allow their attacks to hit me.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:11.50,0:20:15.40,Default,Jogo,0,0,0,,What do we do about his domain, Infinite Void?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:15.40,0:20:22.15,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,The only ones unaffected by Infinite Void are Satoru Gojo himself and anyone he touches.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.57,0:20:29.92,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Even if he does have the skill to selectively trap you all in it,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:29.92,0:20:32.23,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,a great number of non-sorcerers would get crushed
Dialogue: 0,0:20:32.23,0:20:35.17,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,to death in the space left between his domain and the Veil.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:35.50,0:20:39.92,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Chances are 99% that he won't use his domain.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:40.63,0:20:44.45,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,But that means you mustn't use your domains, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:44.45,0:20:47.22,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,If you draw a large mass of non-sorcerers into your domain,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:47.22,0:20:51.27,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,he'll be forced to give up on them and use his, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:51.56,0:20:54.93,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,And you already realize that you can't win a tug-of-war of domains, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:57.94,0:21:01.19,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,At any rate, you just need to get Satoru Gojo to focus.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:01.19,0:21:04.61,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,Focus on defeating cursed spirits and rescuing non-sorcerers.

Dialogue: 0,0:21:46.49,0:21:52.54,Default,Gojo,0,0,0,,I'm saying I'm shocked that you ever thought you could beat me if this is all you've got.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:56.54,0:21:59.33,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,I'll want you to hold out for at least twenty minutes.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:59.67,0:22:05.13,Default,Geto,0,0,0,,After that, it's time for me and the Prison Realm.
